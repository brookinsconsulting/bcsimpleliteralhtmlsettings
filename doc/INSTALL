   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.

   [tar.gz]

cd /path/to/ezpublish;
cd extension;

mkdir bcsimpleliteralhtmlsettings;

     ===========================

     You can optionaly fetch the latest extension source code from GitHub brookinsconsulting bcsimpleliteralhtmlsettings repository into the extension directory

cd /path/to/ezpublish;
cd extension;

or 

unzip brookinsconsulting-bcsimpleliteralhtmlsettings-d1d1411.tar.gz;

4. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish.
   ===========================

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   /path/to/ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcsimpleliteralhtmlsettings

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g /path/to/ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcsimpleliteralhtmlsettings

   ===========================

   You must regenerate autoloads for extension classes to be available via eZ Publish autoloads. This may mean running the following different commands.

php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -e;
